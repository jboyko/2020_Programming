# There is no relationship between raw or bit scores and the size of the database. This is potentially due to the fact that raw and bit scores are dependent on the length of the query, which limits the number of possible matches or mismatches. The E-value has a negative relationship with the size of the database, such that larger databases provide smaller E-values. This suggests that the E-value accounts for the size of the database, with an inherent increased possibility for matches or mismatches as the database increases in size.
